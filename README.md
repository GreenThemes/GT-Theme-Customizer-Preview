GT-Guest-Customizer
===================

The idea is for Guests to be able to "Try Out" customizing your wordpress theme's options without registering an account.

** This is NOT ready for production use. **

Requirements
A test uesr account must be made with rights that enable editing theme options
(http://ednailor.com/2012/04/16/allowing-non-admin-users-to-update-theme-options/)

Then to preview the Customizer the guest needs to login with this account and then browse to the customizer's url.
(The custom customizer's url)

Goals:
No login, or at least saved guest user login.
User has no rights no comment, blog, anything.
User cannot actually save changes made to theme options.
