GT-Theme-Customizer-Preview
===================

The idea is for Guests to be able to "Try Out" customizing your wordpress theme's options without registering an account.

** This should be ready for production use. **

Usage:
A test user is automatically created the first time you visit the customizer username="Guest"

Then use the following Shortcode to create the Guest Login Link.

[GTCustomizer]Click here to Preview this theme's Customizer[/GTCustomizer]

Clicking on the link, log them in as the "Guest" user with access to a pseduo wordpress live customizer.
The Dashboard, and WP_Nav bar are blocked to Guest Users. 
A Menu Item is added to the admin bar so they can also use the customizer previewer.

Future Features?
1. Add a theme selector to the customizer.
2. Make some options for changing the default test account's username, and a list of available themes to choose from.



Multi-site Note:
On east subsite you want the Guest user to be able to work, 
be sure "Guest" user has the Preview Themes role added.
