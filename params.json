(While not logged in, like a real guest or visitor would)\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\nA test user is automatically created the first time you visit the customizer (username=\"Guest\")\r\nClicking on the link, log them in as the \"Guest\" user with access to a \"pseduo\" wordpress live customizer.\r\nThe Dashboard, and WP_Nav bar (wp-admin) are blocked to Guest Users. \r\nA Menu Item is added to the admin bar so they can also use the customizer previewer.\r\n\r\nFuture Features?\r\n1. Add a theme selector to the customizer.\r\n2. Make some options for changing the default test account's username, and a list of available themes to choose from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMulti-site Note:\r\nOn east subsite you want the Guest user to be able to work, \r\nbe sure \"Guest\" user has the Preview Themes role added.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeature Requests and saying thanks:\r\n\r\nPlease donate any amount. As long as I see something, it will encourage me to spend my focus in that area.\r\n\r\nhttp://greenthe.me/donate/ \r\n\r\n\r\n** Changelog **\r\n\r\n1.4.1\r\nUpdated the customizer to work with Wordpress 4.1\r\nFixed the Customizer Preview Toolbar Link\r\n\r\n1.04\r\n\r\nUpdated includes/gt-customizer.php with new Wordpress 3.6 core javascript libraries\r\nNow requires WP 3.6\r\n\r\n\r\n1.03\r\n\r\nRemoved injected styles to remove wpadmin bar fully via functions only\r\nMoved up admin redirect to a faster hook and is_admin check\r\nAdded checking if a \"Guest\" account already exists on another site and adds the existing user to the current demo site automatically and assigns the roles as needed\r\nMade the \"wp-blog-header.php\" require crawl up a few directories looking for it first. Hopefully this will make it work across more different wordpress configurations.\r\n\r\n** TODO **\r\n/includes/gt-customizer.php still has a \"hard\" path set to the wp-admin. This is the same way the offical wordpress customizer works, but since we are in the plugin folder instead of in wp-admin already, we have to search for the admin.php \r\nIn otherwords, if your plugin's are in a strange location relative to wordpress, you'll need to edit that line at the top to suite your needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-38109581-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
