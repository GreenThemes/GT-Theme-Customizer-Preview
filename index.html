<p>** Working on Wordpress 4.1 as of 2/5/2015 **  </p>

<p>The idea is for Guests to be able to "Try Out" customizing your wordpress theme's options without registering an account.</p>

<p>Try it for yourself, live demo on <a href="http://GreenThe.me">http://GreenThe.me</a></p>

<p>** This should be ready for production use, on a demo site. **</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p>Use the following Shortcode to create the Guest Login Link.</p>

<p>[GTCustomizer]Click here to Preview this theme's Customizer[/GTCustomizer]</p>

<p>Visit that page, and try out the link! (While not logged in, like a real guest or visitor would)</p>

<p>How it works:
A test user is automatically created the first time you visit the customizer (username="Guest")
Clicking on the link, log them in as the "Guest" user with access to a "pseduo" wordpress live customizer.
The Dashboard, and WP_Nav bar (wp-admin) are blocked to Guest Users. 
A Menu Item is added to the admin bar so they can also use the customizer previewer.</p>

<p>Future Features?
1. Add a theme selector to the customizer.
2. Make some options for changing the default test account's username, and a list of available themes to choose from.</p>

<p>Multi-site Note:
On east subsite you want the Guest user to be able to work, 
be sure "Guest" user has the Preview Themes role added.</p>

<p>Feature Requests and saying thanks:</p>

<p>Please donate any amount. As long as I see something, it will encourage me to spend my focus in that area.</p>

<p>** Changelog **</p>

<p>1.4.1
Updated the customizer to work with Wordpress 4.1
Fixed the Customizer Preview Toolbar Link</p>

<p>1.04</p>

<p>Updated includes/gt-customizer.php with new Wordpress 3.6 core javascript libraries
Now requires WP 3.6</p>

<p>1.03</p>

<p>Removed injected styles to remove wpadmin bar fully via functions only
Moved up admin redirect to a faster hook and is_admin check
Added checking if a "Guest" account already exists on another site and adds the existing user to the current demo site automatically and assigns the roles as needed
Made the "wp-blog-header.php" require crawl up a few directories looking for it first. Hopefully this will make it work across more different wordpress configurations.</p>

<p>** TODO **
/includes/gt-customizer.php still has a "hard" path set to the wp-admin. This is the same way the offical wordpress customizer works, but since we are in the plugin folder instead of in wp-admin already, we have to search for the admin.php 
In otherwords, if your plugin's are in a strange location relative to wordpress, you'll need to edit that line at the top to suite your needs.</p>
